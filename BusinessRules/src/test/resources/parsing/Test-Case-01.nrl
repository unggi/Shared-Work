// Examples of long "dotted" access paths
Definition:
    "is an interest rate swap"
Given:
    Product("instrument")
Value:
    The instrument.standard.type is equal to "InterestRateSwap"

Validation:
    "Interest Rate Swap - Exactly two Legs"
Context:
    Product("instrument")
Constraint:
    If the instrument <<is an interest rate swap>>
    then the number of legs is equal to 2

--Validation:
--    "Interest Rate Swap - Requires fixed and floating legs"
--Context:
--    Instrument("instrument")
--Constraint:
--    If the instrument is a kind of InterestRateSwap
--    then one of the legs has type = "fixed" and one of the legs has type = "float"
